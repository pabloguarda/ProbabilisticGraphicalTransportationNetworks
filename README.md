# Probabilistic Graphical Transportation Networks

This is the final project of the course 10-708 Probablistic Graphical Models at Carnegie Mellon University. It studies the use of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Network to estimate Origin-Destination matrices. The analysis are performed using synthetic data and it has `TensorFlow` as one of the main dependencies.

## Development setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment (e.g. "venv") `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 main.py`
